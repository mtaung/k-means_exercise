# k-means Clustering Exercise 

This repository contains some code for an afternoon exercise writing a simple k-means algorithm from scratch. The goal was to write the algorithm with only the mathematical formulations as a reference, i.e. without the use of reference source code. It is by no means intended to be performant or exhaustive in functionality. 

The dataset for testing was acquired from Franti & Sieranoja's clustering benchmark datasets.
